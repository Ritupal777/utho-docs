# HOW TO UPGRADE TLS VERSION TO 1.3 IN WINDOWS

## INTRODUCTION
In this article, we will walk through the steps taken to enable TLS 1.3 in Windows server.

## What is TLS?
**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. It is widely used for encrypting data transmissions on the internet, including web browsing (HTTPS), email, and VoIP.

### Key Features of TLS:
1. **Encryption** – Protects data from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.
2. **Authentication** – Ensures that the communicating parties (such as a user and a website) are who they claim to be.
3. **Data Integrity** – Prevents data from being tampered with during transmission.

## HOW TO ENABLE TLS 1.3
